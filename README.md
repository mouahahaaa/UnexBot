# UnexBot

Discord bot developped entirely in Python used for a tournament on a Game.

Took me about 1 week to develop it and publish it (might be incomplete at some point, but we were short in time).

I used GSheet API to store data as it wasn't consequent and a requirement from the tournament owners.

Developped with Pycharm and uploaded on a VPS to run it 24/7 with npm as NodeJS package manager.

Stopped to run about 2 months after its first breath.
